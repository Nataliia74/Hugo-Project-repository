Here are some of my projects:

1. #### TV Show Browser Project – [Description](https://cyf-nataliia74-tv.netlify.app/)

Built a web application that consumes data from a public API to display TV shows and episodes in a clean, user-friendly interface. Implemented filtering functionality to help users quickly find specific shows or episodes, improving overall user experience. Focused on DOM manipulation and responsive design to ensure the content was visually appealing and easy to navigate. Strengthened skills in **_JavaScript_**, **_HTML_**, **_CSS_**, and **_API integration_** while working in an agile, collaborative environment.

2. #### Power BI Project: Gender Pay Gap Analysis – [Description](https://datacolleges.education/power-bi-example-nataliia-v/)

Developed a **_Power BI_** dashboard to compare the Gender Pay Gap in **_Ukraine_** and the **_UK_**.
